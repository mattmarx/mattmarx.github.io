                <p>As Faculty Director of <i>Entrepreneurship@Cornell</i>, I am tasked with coordinating our campus-wide entrepreneurial curriculum. Despite its non-metropolitan location, Cornell ranks in the top 5 or top 6 worldwide for <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pitchbook-university-rankings">undergrad who have founded venture-backed startups</a>, and also top 5 for "unicorns." Nearly one in seven Cornellians becomes an entrepreneur at some point in their career. </p>
                <p>My main focus as Faculty Director has been revamping the undergraduate Entrepreneurship Minor. The revised Entrepreneurship Minor is streamlined, with a Practicum capstone, a new Hackathon course, and a relaunched gateway/survey course that received 5.0/5.0 ratings from two different instructors last year. Enrollment in the Entrepreneurship Minor is up nearly 30% since last year. This year we are introducing an undergraduate-level course on Venture Financing. We also launched a <a href="https://eship.cornell.edu/entrepreneurship-courses-and-minors/">sortable list of entrepreneurship courses by topic</a>.</p>
                <p>My own teaching is at the undergraduate, MBA, and Executive levels, primarily on entrepreneurship but also innovation. I've received 5.0/5.0 ratings more than half a dozen semesters and in 2024 was recognized with the Undergraduate Teaching Award from the Cornell Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. I enthusiastically use the case method but take precautions to avoid the sort of bias that can arise when not administered carefully, and which has led many institutions to limit the % of final grade from class participation. I use a six-step approach to promote a fair classroom:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Confess.</b> Tell your students on day one that participation grading is <i>inherently unfair</i> because the instructor has to call on you (unlike a quiz, where everyone "participates"). Ask them to tell you (or a TA) if they feel like they are not getting an opportunity to participate. </li>
                    <li><b>Transcribe comments.</b> Enlist a TA to write down a short summary of what everyone says (but do the grading yourself). If possible, record the class so you can double-check.</li>
                    <li><b>Warm calls</b> for quiet students. This technique I learned from the great instructor <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=3c08956d1bdcbb1eJmltdHM9MTcyNTQ5NDQwMCZpZ3VpZD0yYWViODYwNC0xMGU5LTZhZDQtMTM5ZC05MjY0MTE5NzZiYWQmaW5zaWQ9NTIxNQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=2aeb8604-10e9-6ad4-139d-926411976bad&psq=jan+rivkin&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGJzLmVkdS9mYWN1bHR5L1BhZ2VzL3Byb2ZpbGUuYXNweD9mYWNJZD02NTM5&ntb=1">Jan Rivkin</a>. Go up to a student just before class and ask them if they are willing to start the class that day. If not, it's as if they passed on a cold call, but without the public humiliation. </li>
                    <li><b>Don't call on the first student to raise their hand.</b> I used to do this, but one student helped me understand that I was unconsciously disfavoring students for whom English was a second language. "I need a few seconds to translate the thoughts in my head," s/he said in the post-semester feedback.</li>
                    <li><b>Track demographics.</b> Break down the participation grades by native language, gender, sides of the room, seniors vs. juniors, business vs. non-business students, or other relevant margins. Tell the students every few weeks how they are doing, both individuallyh and as subgroups.</v></li>
                    <li><b>Blind-graded written work</b> to balance out participation. </li>
